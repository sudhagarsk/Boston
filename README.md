# Boston Housing Data Sorting

This project fetches the **Boston housing dataset**, sorts the data by a specific field, and displays the top 5 entries in an HTML page.

## Features

- **Data Sorting**: The dataset is sorted based on the 12th index of each data entry.
- **Top 5 Display**: After sorting, the top 5 items are displayed dynamically on the page.
- **Modular JavaScript**: The code uses ES6 modules, separating the dataset and logic into different files.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the page
- **JavaScript (ES6 modules)**: Sorting and displaying the data

## How It Works

1. The data is imported from `boston.js`, which contains the dataset.
2. The data is sorted in descending order by the 12th index (likely a housing price or some other metric).
3. The top 5 sorted results are dynamically added to the HTML page.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boston-housing-data.git
